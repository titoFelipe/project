We'll code an application that will be able to do the following:

1. Deposit money
2. Show the balance of the users account
3. Withdraw money 
4. Reject a withdraw transaction if the amount trying to withdraw is bigger than the current balance

Note: Remember that we need to update the balance after each transaction (withdraw/deposit)
Note: Try to make your code nice and easy to maintain, so that it will be easier to extend our application, if we decide to add more features
